# **Documentation**

Welcome to my documentation Page. This section contains a collection of guides and troubleshooting steps I have written based on real-world issues I encountered while working in my HPC and Linux environments.

## Important Note

All the documents here have been written **by me** based on the issues I faced in my **work environment**. Please note that:

* **The solutions may not be 100% accurate** in all scenarios. These steps worked in **my specific environment**, and they may not be suitable for other setups or configurations.
* The **screenshots** and **installation photos** included in the documentation were taken from my **personal laptop**. They do not reflect cluster-level installations or setups. As such, the images may not match the exact appearance or setup of your production environment.
* This documentation is a **personal record** of the issues I resolved and may require adjustments for use in different environments.

Please use this documentation as a **reference** to guide your work, but remember to adapt it to fit your specific system requirements and configurations.
