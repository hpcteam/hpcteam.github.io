---
I am a Linux Systems Administrator and HPC Engineer with two years of hands-on experience managing large-scale, high-performance computing (HPC) environments designed for government and enterprise research workloads. My focus is on ensuring the reliability, performance, and availability of production-grade HPC infrastructures.

I have played a key role in the deployment and ongoing operations of India’s 11-Petaflops supercomputing infrastructure, supporting environments with over 1,300 compute nodes and NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerator systems. My core responsibilities include cluster provisioning, operating system management, workload scheduling, system monitoring, and troubleshooting across both CPU and GPU-based clusters to ensure optimal performance and minimal downtime.

---

## **Core Responsibilities**

OS Provisioning and Node Lifecycle Management:
Managing the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of operating systems across compute nodes, ensuring proper setup, updates, and lifecycle management throughout the node’s usage.

Scheduler Integration and Workload Execution Using PBS Pro:
Configuring and optimizing PBS Pro for efficient workload scheduling, ensuring optimal resource allocation and smooth execution of tasks across HPC systems.

Continuous Monitoring and Health Validation:
Conducting ongoing monitoring of system performance, validating hardware and software health, and proactively addressing potential issues to maintain system integrity.

User Access Control and System-Level Troubleshooting:
Managing user access to the HPC environment, troubleshooting system-level issues related to both hardware and software, and ensuring minimal disruptions to users and workloads.

System Monitoring Tools:
Utilizing monitoring platforms such as Bright Cluster Manager, Dell OpenManage Enterprise, and InfiniBand UFM to detect and resolve issues early, ensuring system availability and performance, with an uptime target of 99.99% in production environments.

## Performance & Optimization

I regularly perform **cluster benchmarking and validation** using **HPL, LINPACK, and HPCC**, ensuring that systems operate at expected performance levels. My work includes tuning configurations to maintain stable throughput and efficient resource utilization.

I also support **high-speed InfiniBand (400 Gb/s) networks**, monitoring link health, resolving connectivity issues, and assisting in performance optimization for distributed workloads.

---

## Applications & HPC Software

I install, configure, and validate both **commercial and open-source engineering applications** across multi-node environments, including:

* ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX, STAR-CCM+, HEEDS, Altair FEKO
* OpenFOAM, SU2, ParaView

This includes MPI integration, environment module configuration, and ensuring stable application behavior on shared HPC systems. I work with compiler and library stacks such as **AOCC, AOCL, GCC, OpenMPI, and Intel OneAPI** to support consistent and reliable application builds.

---

## Automation & Operations

Automation plays a key role in my daily work. I use **shell scripting** to streamline:

* OS installations and node provisioning
* User onboarding and access management
* Package deployment and environment setup

These efforts have reduced manual administrative tasks, improved deployment efficiency, and lowered user-related support requests.

---

## Infrastructure & Datacenter Work

Alongside software operations, I am actively involved in **hardware and datacenter activities**, including:

* Server integration and validation
* BIOS, firmware, and driver updates
* Hardware troubleshooting on **Dell PowerEdge platforms**

I also contributed to **BSNL’s datacenter modernization project**, supporting server installation, network validation, and OS provisioning across multi-node environments.

---

## Operations & Support

I currently provide **24×7 L2 operational support**, handling incident diagnosis, root-cause analysis, corrective actions, and documentation in **high-availability environments**. My focus is on maintaining stable infrastructure, predictable performance, and a smooth experience for researchers and engineers running compute-intensive workloads.

---

## Focus & Approach

My approach centers on **stability, performance, and scalability**. I aim to build and operate Linux and HPC environments that are reliable, well-monitored, and ready for demanding scientific and engineering workloads.
