I am a Linux Systems Administrator and HPC Engineer with two years of hands-on experience managing large-scale, high-performance computing (HPC) environments designed to support government and enterprise research workloads. My focus is on ensuring the reliability, performance, and availability of production-grade HPC infrastructures.

I have been an integral part of the deployment and ongoing operations of India’s 11-Petaflops supercomputing infrastructure, supporting environments consisting of over 1,300 compute nodes and NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerator systems. My core responsibilities encompass cluster provisioning, operating system management, workload scheduling, system monitoring, hardware management, and troubleshooting across both CPU and GPU-based clusters to ensure high performance and minimal downtime. I also manage storage solutions like Lustre File System to maintain efficient data storage and access across the HPC environment.

## Core Responsibilities

**OS Provisioning and Node Lifecycle Management:**
Managing the provisioning, configuration, and maintenance of operating systems across compute nodes, ensuring proper setup, updates, and lifecycle management throughout the node's usage. This includes integrating hardware and software to ensure the entire system runs efficiently.

**Hardware Management and Troubleshooting:**
Responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting hardware components such as CPUs, memory modules, network interface cards (NICs), and storage devices. I address hardware failures, perform component replacements, and ensure optimal hardware functionality across the entire cluster.

**Scheduler Integration and Workload Execution Using PBS Pro:**
Basic Configuring and optimizing PBS Pro for efficient workload scheduling, ensuring smooth execution of tasks across both CPU and GPU-based clusters. I fine-tune resource allocation to maximize system performance and minimize job queuing delays.

**Lustre File System Management and Troubleshooting:**
Maintenance of  Lustre File System to ensure high-performance, scalable storage across multiple compute nodes. I troubleshoot data access issues, optimize file system performance, and ensure data integrity and availability for research workloads.

**Continuous Monitoring and Health Validation:**
Monitoring system performance in real-time, validating hardware and software health, and addressing potential issues proactively. I use tools like Dell OpenManage Enterprise (OME) and Bright Cluster Manager for hardware and system health validation, ensuring the cluster remains fully operational.

**User Access Control and System-Level Troubleshooting:**
Managing user access and permissions within the HPC environment, ensuring security protocols are followed. I troubleshoot system-level issues related to hardware, software, and network connectivity, minimizing disruptions to the workflow.

**Application Installation and Library Management:**
Installing and configuring both commercial and open-source applications on the cluster, ensuring all required dependencies are met. I manage the installation of essential libraries (e.g., MPI, CUDA, OpenCL) and resolve compatibility issues to ensure applications run smoothly and efficiently.

**System Monitoring Tools:**
Utilizing platforms like Bright Cluster Manager, Dell OpenManage Enterprise (OME), and InfiniBand UFM to monitor system performance, track hardware health, and resolve issues early. This ensures high system availability (with an uptime target of 99.99%) and optimized performance for distributed workloads.

**High-Speed InfiniBand (400 Gb/s) Network Support:**
Supporting InfiniBand networks by monitoring link health, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and assisting with network optimization. I ensure that network performance remains strong, which is essential for high-throughput data transfer in HPC environments.

## **Automation & Operations**

Automation plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and reducing manual effort across various aspects of server management. I leverage **shell scripting** to automate several key operations, such as:

* **Server Configuration and Actions**:
  Using shell scripts to automate **server configurations**, ensuring uniformity across all systems. This includes managing **hardware drivers**, **system settings**, and verifying that all servers are configured consistently with the required parameters.

* **Server Monitoring and Data Collection**:
  Automating **server monitoring** tasks, including **collecting server data** (CPU, memory) and **checking the status of critical services**. This allows me to quickly identify potential issues, such as **resource exhaustion** or **service failures**, and take action to prevent disruptions.

* **Identifying Configuration Issues**:
  Writing scripts to identify **hardware or driver mismatches** across servers. This ensures that all servers have the correct **hardware driver configurations**, preventing inconsistencies that could affect performance or cause errors.

## **Operations & Support**

I provide 24×7 L2 operational support in high-availability environments, focusing on:

* Incident diagnosis and root-cause analysis

* Corrective actions and continuous system optimization

* Comprehensive documentation of troubleshooting processes and solutions

My primary goal is to ensure a stable infrastructure, predictable performance, and a smooth experience for researchers and engineers working on compute-intensive workloads, maintaining uptime and reliability across all systems.

## **Focus & Approach**

My approach is focused on three key areas: stability, performance, and scalability. I work to create and maintain Linux and HPC environments that are:

* Reliable: Making sure systems are strong, secure, and perform well at all times.

* Well-monitored: Keeping an eye on system health to spot any issues early.

* Ready for demanding tasks: Setting up systems that can handle scientific and engineering workloads, ensuring they meet the needs of complex computing tasks.
