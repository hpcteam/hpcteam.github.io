# **Roles & Responsibilities**

This section outlines my key roles and responsibilities in supporting large-scale Linux and high-performance computing (HPC) environments in production settings.

### HPC Operations & Administration

* Manage and support multi-petaflop HPC environments for research workloads.
* Perform tasks like setting up and managing compute nodes, from installation to decommissioning.
* Support workload scheduling using PBS Pro to ensure tasks run smoothly in shared environments.
* Ensure stable job execution across both CPU and GPU-based clusters.

### System Monitoring & Reliability

* Monitor system health and availability using tools like **NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager**, **Dell OpenManage Enterprise**, and **InfiniBand UFM**.
* Run proactive health checks to identify potential issues in hardware, networks, or systems.
* Respond to alerts and incidents to minimize disruptions and maintain system uptime.
* Ensure high availability of systems in 24×7 production environments.

### Performance Validation & Optimization

* Run performance benchmarks using tools like **HPL**, **LINPACK**, and **HPCC**.
* Validate performance after system upgrades, changes, or new deployments.
* Work on fine-tuning system performance to meet operational goals.

### Application & User Support

* Install, configure, and validate both commercial and open-source applications in HPC environments.
* Support running applications that use **MPI** for multi-node execution.
* Manage environment modules and application runtime settings to ensure smooth operation.
* Provide user onboarding, access management, and technical support to researchers and engineers.

### Automation & Operational Efficiency

* Write shell scripts to automate common administrative tasks.
* Automate processes like OS provisioning, user management, and software deployment.
* Streamline operations to improve consistency and reduce manual effort.

### Hardware & Infrastructure Support

* Assist with server installation, integration, and validation in datacenter environments.
* Perform BIOS, firmware, and driver upgrades on **Dell PowerEdge** platforms.
* Troubleshoot hardware issues and assist with diagnostics and repairs.
* Help coordinate infrastructure changes during upgrades and system expansions.

### Networking Support

* Manage high-speed **InfiniBand (400 Gb/s)** networking for HPC clusters.
* Monitor network health, fix connectivity issues, and optimize performance.
* Ensure network readiness for running large-scale parallel workloads.

### Incident Management & Documentation

* Provide L2-level incident support in high-availability environments.
* Analyze and troubleshoot system issues, then take corrective actions.
* Document incidents, solutions, and operational procedures for future reference.
* Support activities related to system changes and updates.

### Datacenter & Project Support

* Contribute to projects aimed at datacenter modernization and infrastructure deployment.
* Support tasks like server installation, OS provisioning, and network setup.
* Work closely with cross-functional teams during project execution and handover.
