### India’s Multi-Petaflops HPC Cluster Deployment

I was part of the core team responsible for deploying and maintaining a multi-petaflops high-performance computing system used for national research and government tasks.

**Scope & Contributions:**

* Supported an HPC environment delivering about 11 Petaflops of compute power.
* Managed clusters with over 1,300+ compute nodes and NVIDIA H100 GPUs.
* Managed **13 Petabytes** of **Lustre** storage, including monitoring and troubleshooting for optimal performance.
* Supported **30 Petabytes** of tape library storage to ensure secure and efficient data archiving and retrieval.
* Set up and configure the cluster using **NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager**.
* Managed job scheduling and task execution using **PBS Pro** in shared environments.
* Validated system performance using **HPL**, **LINPACK**, and **HPCC** to ensure stable compute throughput.
* Participated in checks before production launch, confirming that compute, network, and monitoring systems were fully operational.
* Monitored and troubleshot **400 Gb/s InfiniBand** fabric during cluster operations.
* This project required high standards of performance, availability, and reliability for national research workloads.

### Datacenter Infrastructure Modernization

I contributed to a major datacenter modernization project to support enterprise and HPC-ready infrastructure.

**Scope & Contributions:**

* Supported server installation and integration in the datacenter environment.
* Handled operating system installation and validation across several nodes.
* Assisted with network connectivity tests and system readiness checks.
* Supported hardware configuration, firmware validation, and initial system setup.
* Worked closely with infrastructure and networking teams to ensure smooth deployment and transition to production.
* This project aimed to improve infrastructure reliability, scalability, and readiness for HPC and enterprise workloads.

### Ongoing Operational Projects

Along with large deployments, I am involved in several ongoing operational projects, including:

* Cluster expansion and adding new nodes
* Hardware refreshes and firmware upgrades
* Performance validation after system updates or changes
* Automating processes for provisioning and administration
* Addressing incidents and improving systems based on feedback
