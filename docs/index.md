## **Professional Overview**

I support and operate large-scale Linux and HPC environments used for mission-critical
research and engineering workloads. My responsibilities include cluster administration,
job scheduling, monitoring, automation, and incident management across CPU and GPU-based systems.

I have contributed to the deployment and sustained operation of India’s multi-petaflops
HPC infrastructure, supporting environments with over 1,300+ compute nodes and
NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerators.
