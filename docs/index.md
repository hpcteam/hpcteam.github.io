# Ayyappaswamy Eethakota

**Linux Systems Administrator** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Engineer** with
hands-on experience supporting **large-scale**, production-grade HPC environments
for **government** and **enterprise** research workloads.

This site documents my professional experience, technical skills, and operational
knowledge gained while working on multi-petaflop HPC infrastructure, GPU-accelerated
clusters, high-speed InfiniBand networks, and enterprise Linux systems.

## **Professional Overview**

I support and operate large-scale Linux and HPC environments used for mission-critical
research and engineering workloads. My responsibilities include cluster administration,
job scheduling, monitoring, automation, and incident management across CPU and GPU-based systems.

I have contributed to the deployment and sustained operation of India’s multi-petaflops
HPC infrastructure, supporting environments with over 1,300+ compute nodes and
NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerators.

## **Operational Knowledge Base**

This site includes a detailed collection of real-world operational issues and
troubleshooting scenarios encountered in production environments, such as:

- User access, SSH, and network connectivity issues  
- Job scheduling, queue, and execution failures  
- Benchmarking and performance validation errors  
- GPU driver, CUDA, and accelerator-related issues  
- Cluster management  problems  
- InfiniBand fabric and communication issues  
- Hardware-level faults (disk, NIC, DIMM, CPU)  
- Software installation and compilation errors  

These scenarios are documented to reflect practical problem-solving approaches
used in enterprise HPC operations.
