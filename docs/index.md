# Ayyappaswamy Eethakota

**Linux Systems Administrator** and **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Engineer** with
hands-on experience supporting **large-scale**, production-grade HPC environments
for **government** and **enterprise** research workloads.

This site documents my professional experience, technical skills, and operational
knowledge gained while working on multi-petaflop HPC infrastructure, GPU-accelerated
clusters, high-speed InfiniBand networks, and enterprise Linux systems.

## **Professional Overview**

I support and operate large-scale Linux and HPC environments used for mission-critical
research and engineering workloads. My responsibilities include cluster administration,
job scheduling, monitoring, automation, and incident management across CPU and GPU-based systems.

I have contributed to the deployment and sustained operation of India’s multi-petaflops
HPC infrastructure, supporting environments with over 1,300+ compute nodes and
NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerators.
