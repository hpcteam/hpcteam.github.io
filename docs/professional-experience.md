My role involves day-to-day production support, cluster operations, performance
validation, and infrastructure maintenance across CPU and GPU-based HPC systems.

### Key Responsibilities & Contributions

- Administered and supported large-scale HPC clusters comprising over **1,200 compute
  nodes** and **GPU accelerator nodes with NVIDIA H100 GPUs**, sustaining production
  workloads at **multi-petaflop scale**.
- Managed HPC environments using **NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager**, including cluster
  provisioning, node lifecycle management, configuration updates, and system validation.
- Supported workload scheduling and job execution using **PBS Pro**, ensuring stable
  and predictable job execution in shared environments.
- Performed continuous system monitoring and health checks using **Bright Cluster
  Manager**, **Dell OpenManage Enterprise**, and **InfiniBand UFM**, contributing to
  **99.99% system availability**.
- Executed **OS provisioning, patching, and configuration management** across compute
  and management nodes in production environments.
- Automated routine administrative tasks using **shell scripting**, improving
  operational efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
- Installed, configured, and validated **commercial and open-source HPC applications**
  across multi-node environments, including MPI integration and environment module
  configuration.
- Conducted **performance benchmarking and validation** using **HPL, LINPACK, and
  HPCC**, ensuring systems met expected throughput and floating-point performance
  targets.
- Supported **400 Gb/s InfiniBand networking**, including fabric monitoring,
  troubleshooting connectivity issues, and assisting with performance tuning.
- Performed **hardware-level operations**, including BIOS, firmware, and driver
  upgrades on **Dell PowerEdge servers**, ensuring compliance with operational and
  security standards.
- Provided **24×7 L2 operational support**, handling incident diagnosis, root-cause
  analysis, corrective actions, and operational documentation.
- Contributed to **BSNL datacenter modernization activities**, supporting server
  integration, network validation, and operating system provisioning across
  multi-node environments.

This role requires close coordination with infrastructure, networking, and application
teams to ensure stable, secure, and high-performing HPC environments for production use.
