# Projects

This section outlines key projects where I contributed to the deployment, operation,
and stabilization of large-scale HPC and datacenter infrastructure in production
environments.

## India’s Multi-Petaflops HPC Cluster Deployment

I was part of the core operations team supporting the deployment and sustained
operation of a **multi-petaflops high-performance computing environment** used for
national research and government workloads.

### Scope & Contributions

- Supported an HPC environment delivering approximately **11 Petaflops of compute
  performance**.
- Operated and administered clusters consisting of **1,200+ compute nodes** and
  **NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerator nodes**.
- Assisted with **cluster provisioning and configuration** using NVIDIA Bright
  Cluster Manager.
- Supported **workload scheduling and job execution** through PBS Pro in shared
  production environments.
- Performed **system validation and performance benchmarking** using HPL, LINPACK,
  and HPCC to verify compute throughput and stability.
- Participated in **production readiness checks**, ensuring compute, network, and
  monitoring components were operational before user onboarding.
- Supported **400 Gb/s InfiniBand fabric monitoring and troubleshooting** during
  cluster operation.

This project required strict adherence to availability, performance, and operational
standards due to its role in national research workloads.

## BSNL Datacenter Infrastructure Modernization

I contributed to a large-scale datacenter modernization initiative supporting
enterprise and HPC-ready infrastructure.

### Scope & Contributions

- Supported **server installation and physical integration** activities within the
  datacenter environment.
- Performed **operating system provisioning and validation** across multiple nodes.
- Assisted with **network connectivity checks and system readiness validation**.
- Supported **hardware configuration, firmware validation, and initial system
  bring-up** activities.
- Worked with infrastructure and networking teams to ensure **smooth multi-node
  deployment** and operational handover.

This project focused on improving infrastructure reliability, scalability, and
readiness for high-performance and enterprise workloads.

## Ongoing Operational Projects

In addition to major deployments, I regularly contribute to operational initiatives,
including:

- Cluster expansion and node onboarding
- Hardware refresh and firmware upgrade cycles
- Performance validation following system changes
- Automation improvements for provisioning and administration
- Incident-driven corrective actions and system improvements
