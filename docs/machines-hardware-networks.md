## Compute Servers & Platforms

I have hands-on experience working with enterprise-grade server platforms deployed
for high-performance computing and enterprise workloads.

### Dell PowerEdge Servers
- Dell PowerEdge R6625
- Dell PowerEdge R7625
- Dell PowerEdge XE8640 (GPU-accelerated platform)
- Dell PowerEdge T550

Responsibilities include server validation, operating system installation, firmware
updates, hardware diagnostics, and operational support in production environments.

## GPU & Accelerator Hardware

I support GPU-enabled compute platforms used for compute-intensive and simulation
workloads.

- NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerator nodes
- Multi-GPU server configurations
- GPU health, utilization, and thermal monitoring
- Support for GPU-enabled HPC applications

## Networking Infrastructure

Reliable networking is critical for HPC performance and cluster stability. I work
with both Ethernet and InfiniBand-based interconnects.

### InfiniBand Networking
- NVIDIA InfiniBand QM9700 / QM9790 switches
- 400 Gb/s InfiniBand fabric
- Fabric monitoring and issue resolution
- Link and port-level troubleshooting

### Ethernet Networking
- Dell S3100 switches (1G / 10G)
- Network connectivity validation
- Support for management and service networks

## Hardware Management & Monitoring

I use enterprise hardware management and monitoring tools to maintain system health
and availability.

- Dell OpenManage Enterprise (OME)
- NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager
- InfiniBand UFM

These tools are used for proactive fault detection, alert handling, and coordinated
hardware maintenance.

## Datacenter Operations

I am involved in datacenter-level operational activities, including:

- Server rack mounting and physical integration
- Cabling coordination and validation
- BIOS, firmware, and driver upgrade cycles
- Hardware troubleshooting and vendor coordination
- Supporting infrastructure expansion and refresh activities
