I am a **Linux Systems Administrator and HPC Engineer** with nearly **two years of hands-on experience** supporting **large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) environments** used for **government and enterprise research workloads**. My work focuses on operating and maintaining **production-grade HPC infrastructure**, where reliability, performance consistency, and availability are critical.

I have contributed to the deployment and sustained operation of **India’s 11-Petaflops supercomputing infrastructure**, working on environments comprising **1,200+ compute nodes and NVIDIA H100 GPU accelerator systems**. My responsibilities include **cluster provisioning, operating system management, workload scheduling, monitoring, and troubleshooting** across CPU and GPU-based clusters.

## What I Do

In my current role at **TIS Labs Pvt. Ltd.**, I manage and support HPC systems using **NVIDIA Bright Cluster Manager**, handling:

* OS provisioning and node lifecycle management
* Scheduler integration and workload execution using **PBS Pro**
* Continuous monitoring and health validation
* User access control and system-level troubleshooting

I work with monitoring platforms such as **Bright Cluster Manager**, **Dell OpenManage Enterprise**, and **InfiniBand UFM** to detect issues early and maintain **high system availability (99.99%)** in production environments.

---

## Performance & Optimization

I regularly perform **cluster benchmarking and validation** using **HPL, LINPACK, and HPCC**, ensuring that systems operate at expected performance levels. My work includes tuning configurations to maintain stable throughput and efficient resource utilization.

I also support **high-speed InfiniBand (400 Gb/s) networks**, monitoring link health, resolving connectivity issues, and assisting in performance optimization for distributed workloads.

---

## Applications & HPC Software

I install, configure, and validate both **commercial and open-source engineering applications** across multi-node environments, including:

* ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS CFX, STAR-CCM+, HEEDS, Altair FEKO
* OpenFOAM, SU2, ParaView

This includes MPI integration, environment module configuration, and ensuring stable application behavior on shared HPC systems. I work with compiler and library stacks such as **AOCC, AOCL, GCC, OpenMPI, and Intel OneAPI** to support consistent and reliable application builds.

---

## Automation & Operations

Automation plays a key role in my daily work. I use **shell scripting** to streamline:

* OS installations and node provisioning
* User onboarding and access management
* Package deployment and environment setup

These efforts have reduced manual administrative tasks, improved deployment efficiency, and lowered user-related support requests.

---

## Infrastructure & Datacenter Work

Alongside software operations, I am actively involved in **hardware and datacenter activities**, including:

* Server integration and validation
* BIOS, firmware, and driver updates
* Hardware troubleshooting on **Dell PowerEdge platforms**

I also contributed to **BSNL’s datacenter modernization project**, supporting server installation, network validation, and OS provisioning across multi-node environments.

---

## Operations & Support

I currently provide **24×7 L2 operational support**, handling incident diagnosis, root-cause analysis, corrective actions, and documentation in **high-availability environments**. My focus is on maintaining stable infrastructure, predictable performance, and a smooth experience for researchers and engineers running compute-intensive workloads.

---

## Focus & Approach

My approach centers on **stability, performance, and scalability**. I aim to build and operate Linux and HPC environments that are reliable, well-monitored, and ready for demanding scientific and engineering workloads.
