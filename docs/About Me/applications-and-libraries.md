# Applications & Libraries

This page outlines the commercial applications, open-source software, and
libraries/toolchains I have worked with while supporting production Linux and
High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. The focus includes installation,
configuration, integration, and operational support across multi-node clusters.

## Commercial Applications

I have worked with the following commercial engineering and simulation applications
in HPC environments. Responsibilities include installation, configuration, MPI
integration, environment module setup, and runtime support for users.

- **ANSYS Fluent**
- **ANSYS CFX**
- **STAR-CCM+**
- **HEEDS**
- **Altair FEKO**

Activities performed:
- Installation and validation on multi-node HPC clusters
- MPI and scheduler integration (PBS Pro / Slurm)
- Environment module creation and maintenance
- Supporting batch and interactive job execution
- Troubleshooting runtime and performance-related issues

## Open-Source Applications

I have supported and operated the following open-source applications commonly used
in scientific computing and research workloads.

- **OpenFOAM**
- **SU2**
- **ParaView**
- **WRF**

Activities performed:
- Source-based installation and configuration
- MPI integration and multi-node execution testing
- Environment setup and user support
- Troubleshooting build, runtime, and scaling issues

## Compilers, Libraries & Toolchains

I have worked with the following compilers and libraries to support application builds
and runtime execution in HPC environments.

### Compilers
- **AOCC (AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler)**
- **GCC**
- **Intel OneAPI Toolkit**

### Libraries & MPI
- **AOCL (AMD Optimized CPU Libraries)**
- **OpenMPI**

Activities performed:
- Application compilation and build validation
- Library and compiler compatibility checks
- Runtime library configuration
- Supporting CPU and GPU-enabled workloads

## Operational Scope

Across all applications and libraries, my responsibilities include:

- Installation and upgrade validation
- Dependency and compatibility checks
- Scheduler and resource manager integration
- Environment module management
- User support and issue resolution
- Coordination with infrastructure and application teams
